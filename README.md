## What is Hackanect ?
Hackanect App is a place where you can find other developers to team up and collaborate for a project. Whether you are looking to team up with someone for a Hackathon or just collaborate with someone on a project - this is the right place to explore. You can sign up on Hackanect and create a profile, especially mentioning your Tech Stack.

## Find Users:

- You have the option whether you are looking to team up for a Hackathon or not. *It would only connect you to devs who are participating in that Hackathon*

- __Next you agin have two options__
    - Find someone similar to your own Tech Stack(*In case you want to collaborate with someone who works in same Tech Stack as you*)
    - Or you specify a Tech Stack yourself(*Let's say you are a frontend developer but are looking for a backend developer, so mention the tech stack you are looking for and it will search according to that*)

### There is a light ML model at the backend which does this similarity check and recommends users.

## Chats Feature
__We have also kept a Chats feature so that you can chat with the developer you are interested to collaborate with and probably exchange contacts__
